## Nasm   
* There is a question why `org` and `vstart` not work in `elf32`, because in the doc of nasm has such sentence about it `The bin format provides an additional directive to the list given in chapter 7: ORG`, then it means only suit for bin format.  

## Makefile  
`https://makefiletutorial.com/#makefile-cookbook`  
* **Makefiles must be indented using TABs and not spaces or make will fail.** 换行时候缩进错误也会影响语法。 

## QEMU

* gdb连接端口后，记得设断点。
